# Task-1
Here i print an Audi logo using turtle in python,
Printing an audi logo by printing a circle then lifting the pen then putting down the pen, to a new positon then repeating this procedure more 3 times to get the iconic
Audi logo, i am even changing the pointer to a circle with the background to balck and the pen colour to silver

Task 2: I troubleshooted a lot, but still i did not manage to get opencv working in my laptop in time but after one hour i did, output_video is the output from that code i submitted in time. i found that it wasn't adding blank frames so i wrote a different code and achieved the desired result, a bit late , sorry for that ,we have our cat's today so it took a bit more time than it was supposed to..

output.mp4 is the desired output video and opencv.py is the desired code sorry for the delay again
